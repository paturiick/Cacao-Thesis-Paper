	\section{Background of the Study}
\textit{Theobroma cacao}, widely known as cacao, is one of the most economically influential crops in the world. It serves as the primary raw material for the multibillion-dollar chocolate industry, supporting the livelihoods of approximately six million small-scale farmers globally \citep{wickramasuriya2018cacao}. Once harvested, cacao seeds are processed to produce cocoa powder and cocoa butter—essential ingredients in a wide range of products, from confections and beverages to cosmetics and pharmaceuticals.

The global chocolate market is projected to grow significantly from 129.1 billion dollars in 2025, and up to 178.7 billion dollars by 2035 \citep{FutureMarketInsights2025ChocolateForecast}. However, \cite{Exquisito2025CocoaShortage} reported that West Africa, which supplies over 70\% of the world’s cocoa, have experienced a 13.1\% year-on-year decrease in cocoa output in 2024 (from 5.044 to 4.382 million tons), which constitutes a drastic decline in yield. This is largely driven by black pod disease caused by Phytophthora species, with Phytophthora megakarya recognized as the dominant and most destructive pathogen in the region \citep{OpokuMegakaryaThreat, BlackPodReview2024}.

A comparable situation is observed in the Philippines. While P. megakarya dominates West Africa, black pod disease in the Philippines is primarily caused by Phytophthora palmivora (\textit{P. palmivora}). The Davao Region, the country’s major cacao-producing area and officially recognized as the “Chocolate Capital of the Philippines” \citep{PCAF2021}, has experienced production declines associated with this pathogen. Locally referred to as \textit{butikol}, black pod rot caused by P. palmivora has been documented to induce substantial annual yield losses, posing a persistent threat to the sustainability of the Philippine cacao industry \citep{Avila2023}.

The Davao Region, the country’s major cacao-producing area and officially recognized as the “Chocolate Capital of the Philippines” \citep{PCAF2021}, has experienced production declines associated with this pathogen. Although cacao is affected by multiple diseases, black pod rot, locally referred to as \textit{butikol}, caused by \textit{P. palmivora} has been documented to induce substantial annual yield losses, posing a persistent threat to the sustainability of the Philippine cacao industry \citep{Avila2023}. These losses were further corroborated through a field interview with the owner of the Janog Cacao Plantation.

The Janog Cacao Plantation is a 5-hectare cacao farm with over 2,500 cacao trees planted located in Initaon, Misamis Oriental. The owner report yield fluctuations between 100–500 kg of cacao beans, with 300 kg considered satisfactory and anything below 200 kg representing a deficit. If some infected pods are left unnoticed, they can become active infection reservoirs that accelerate outbreak progression. On average, the Janog farm recorded only about 9 in 10 cacao trees are unhealthy, as the disease can quickly spread to nearby pods if infected ones are not pruned or removed promptly. However, completing a full manual inspection cycle requires walking the entire plantation and can take up to three weeks. This on-foot, tree-by-tree monitoring reflects the current dependence on visual scouting, an approach widely described as labor-intensive and error-prone, especially for catching infections at their earliest stages \citep{PhilCacaoRoadmap2021}.

To address these persistent threats, modern agriculture has increasingly turned to advanced technological solutions for early disease detection and intervention. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and deep learning algorithms have emerged as powerful tools in precision agriculture, offering efficient and scalable monitoring of cacao plantations. UAVs, equipped with high-resolution cameras and multispectral sensors, can rapidly survey wide areas, while cutting-edge models such as You Only Look Once (YOLO) provide high-accuracy plant disease identification \citep{Vyas2023}. Early detection during the pre-harvest phase, as supported by \cite{Upadhyay2025,Yadav2024}, enables timely interventions to mitigate crop losses and ensure quality harvests.

Existing technological interventions for cacao disease detection, such as mobile applications that utilize image processing and machine learning, have made strides in bridging the gap. For instance, \cite{Tan2018} developed AuToDiDAC, an app designed to detect black pod rot, while \cite{Tovurawa2025} used convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify cacao leaf diseases. However, these solutions are predominantly dependent on static image inputs and close-range data collection. As noted by \cite{Taesiri2023}, such methods can cause models to focus only on the most discriminative regions of the plant, potentially missing early-stage infections or atypical symptoms that may be spread across the pod’s surface. Additionally, mobile-based approaches require farmers to manually photograph individual pods, which is laborious and impractical for cacao plantations, thereby limiting mobility and scalability.

With these challenges in mind, this study introduces a UAV-based cacao disease detection system that integrates the You Only Look Once (YOLO) algorithm to address the limitations of static, close-range data collection. This approach enables convenient monitoring of difficult terrains like the Janog Cacao Plantation, utilizing deep learning to detect disease symptoms across the entire pod surface that traditional manual methods often miss. Furthermore, the system incorporates geotagging through QGIS to efficiently map infected cacao pods, which are then visualized on a web-based platform to assist farmers in monitoring plantation health.

With these challenges in mind, this study introduces a UAV-based cacao disease detection system that integrates the You Only Look Once (YOLO) object detection algorithm to address the limitations of static, close-range data collection. This approach enables a convenient monitoring of cacao plantations, such as the Janog Cacao Plantation, where manual inspection is physically demanding and time-consuming. Integrating deep learning model with UAV allows for the detection of disease symptoms across the entire pod surface that traditional methods may miss. In addition to detecting infected cacao pods, the study requires a geospatial mapping component to translate detections into location-specific farm actions. QGIS is used to convert UAV GPS-tagged detections into spatial layers and maps that identify affected areas and trees, enabling targeted intervention and repeat monitoring rather than relying on general farm-wide estimates; these geotagged results are then visualized in a web-based platform so farmers can efficiently monitor plantation health and prioritize treatment.

The proposed system will be developed followed by field tests at Janog Cacao Plantation in Initao, Misamis Oriental, to evaluate its performance and functionality in real-world agricultural environment.

\section{Statement of the Problem}

The Philippine cacao industry faces persistent challenges that hinder its ability to meet the demands of both the domestic and international market. Although the country has favorable climate conditions and fertile land, especially in the Davao Region, which represents 78\% of national production, it continues to fall short of its annual production target of 50,000 metric tons. According to the \cite{PhilCacaoRoadmap2021}, this shortfall is largely due to cacao diseases, particularly black pod disease caused by P.\textit{Palmivora}, which leads to post-harvest losses of up to 90\%.

Traditional detection methods rely on manual inspection, which is labor intensive, slow, and prone to human error, leading to delayed intervention and significant crop losses. Although existing studies explore machine learning and imaging technologies for cacao disease detection, they primarily use static imaging and mobile-based approaches, limiting monitoring and scalability.

\section{Objectives of the Study}

This study aims to design and develop a UAV-based system that detects P.\textit{Palmivora} disease in cacao pods using deep learning model (object detection and disease detection) and GPS geotagging for precise location mapping. Specifically, it seeks to:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Configure a UAV capable of autonomous navigation over cacao farms.
	\item Integrate an object detection model for cacao pod detection and a classification model for identifying black pod rot disease, or \textit{P. palmivora} infection.
	\item Develop and implement a monitoring system that tracks the UAV’s flight status and detection for cacao pod disease.
	\item Test the system’s detection accuracy, classification performance, geotagging precision, and overall operational efficiency.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Significance of the Study}
The study will be conducted at Janog Cacao Plantation in Initao, Misamis Oriental. This will hold significance for multiple sectors within the agricultural and technological landscape. By field-testing a UAV-based disease detection system in an actual cacao farm setting, the research may demonstrate the feasibility and practical benefits of integrating precision agriculture technologies into local farming operations.

For cacao farmers, particularly those managing plantations like Janog Cacao Plantation, the system may offer a convenient solution for early disease detection. It may enable timely intervention to prevent further contamination, helping reduce crop losses, improve yield quality and quantity.

For the cacao and chocolate industry, the study may contribute to sustaining both local and global markets by maintaining consistent raw material availability, controlling production costs, and supporting economic growth in cacao-dependent regions.

For the agricultural sector, the research may promote the modernization of farming through precision agriculture and remote sensing technologies. It may enhance productivity and sustainability, particularly in disease-prone areas where manual inspection is labor-intensive and inefficient.

For the government and policymakers, the study’s outcomes may serve as a basis for aligning technological innovation with the goals of the Philippine Cacao Industry Roadmap. It may provide valuable insights for policy formulation, funding assistance, and small to medium-scale implementation of technology-based interventions. Further, it may contributes to the realization of Sustainable Development Goals (SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth, and SDG 15: Life on Land) by promoting sustainable agriculture, increasing farmer income, and fostering innovation.

Lastly, for future researchers, this study will serve as a reference for further exploration and enhancement of precision agriculture systems, UAV applications, and plant disease detection technologies. It will also provides a real-world benchmark for testing similar systems under tropical agricultural conditions.

\section{Scope and Limitations}
This study will focus on the development and testing of a UAV-based disease detection system for cacao farms in Initao, Misamis Oriental. The system integrates three major components: (1) a YOLO-based model for detecting cacao pods; (2) a YOLO-based model to detect visible symptoms of Black Pod Rot infection in cacao pods; (3) GPS and QGIS for efficient geolocation and mapping of affected trees; and (4) a web-based application for monitoring and visualization of detection results.

The study is limited to identifying external symptoms of black pod disease such as visible pod rot and discoloration. Internal infections that do not manifest outwardly cannot be detected by the current implementation. Moreover, while the system can assist in identifying potentially infected pods, it does not automate subsequent farm management tasks such as pruning or removal of diseased pods, which must still be performed manually by farmers. QGIS is included to transform GPS-tagged detections into hotspot maps and tree-level location references for monitoring; however, spatial accuracy remains dependent on UAV GPS precision and capture distance.

The imaging capability of the UAV is constrained by the use of a 720p camera, which may limit the level of visual detail captured and affect detection accuracy under certain environmental conditions. External factors such as lighting, weather conditions, and UAV flight stability may also influence detection performance.

Despite these constraints, the programmable nature of the UAV allows the use of its Software Development Kit (SDK) to define autonomous flight paths, enabling systematic data collection across cacao rows. However, the degree of automation depends on the reliability of the programmed commands and the environmental conditions encountered during flight missions.

These limitations define the operational boundaries of the proposed system and provide considerations for future improvements.

\section{Conceptual Framework}

The study's conceptual framework is presented through an Input-Output-Process Model in Figure \ref{fig:ipo}.

\end{figure}

The process begins with the input stage, where drones are used to capture images of cacao pods in the farm. These images serve as the primary source of information and are compared with sets of sample images showing both healthy and diseased pods. Along with the images, location data is recorded so that each detection can be linked to its exact place in the farm. 

The information collected then moves to the process stage. Here, the pod images are first checked to make them clear and consistent for analysis. After this, the system studies the images to identify whether pods are healthy or show signs of disease. The location data gathered during drone flights is combined with the results, allowing the system to create maps that show the areas where diseases may be present. This stage transforms raw images into useful information that can guide farmers in managing their crops.

In the output stage, the system produces results that are directly useful for farm management. These include the classification of cacao pods as healthy or infected, maps that point out exactly where the infected pods are located, and summary reports. The reports provide details such as the total number of pods detected, the percentage that are infected, and the specific times and places where infections were found.
