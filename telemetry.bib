	abstract  = {Losses, in any form, are inevitable, but they must be addressed, especially when they pose a threat to a nation's economy. Over the years, data and statistics have highlighted the severe impact that infectious and fatal plant diseases have had on farmers, leading to substantial crop production losses. Therefore, addressing this pressing issue is of paramount importance. This paper presents an approach that employs advanced techniques for early detection of plant diseases to mitigate such losses. The proposed method involves capturing an image of a leaf, specifically from a potato plant, and analyzing it using deep learning technology. This analysis determines the plant's health status. If a disease is detected, the system enables farmers to take timely measures to safeguard and protect the remaining healthy crops. This proactive strategy can significantly reduce economic losses and support sustainable agriculture.},

	abstract  = {Food security is a vital aspect of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) which aims to promote sustainable farming in the world. Farming-driven economies such as Ghana are faced with challenges due to plant diseases. Cacao, a vital crop in Ghana is severely impacted with diseases which affect its yield and decrease exports revenue through reduced exports. Leveraging deep learning techniques offers an effective solution for early detection of diseases in cacao plants. This study adopts a comprehensive approach, starting with an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the dataset containing images of both healthy and diseased cacao plants from Ghanaian farms. Using exploratory data analysis (EDA), we can identify patterns and understand the characteristics of the dataset, laying a solid foundation for developing robust machine learning models tailored to the specific challenges faced by Ghanaian cacao farmers. Our approach involves developing and evaluating deep learning models to detect and classify cacao plant diseases. These models are designed with the Predictability, Compatibility, and Stability (PCS) framework in mind, ensuring reliability and effectiveness in disease detection. The custom convolution neural network (CNN) model outperformed other models considered in experimental analysis. This study aims to revolutionize cacao farming through precise, stable, and ethical deep learning solutions, ultimately enhancing crop resilience, productivity, and the livelihood of Ghanaian farmers.}

	abstract  = {Image classifiers are information-discarding machines, by design. Yet, how these models discard information remains mysterious. We hypothesize that one way for image classifiers to reach high accuracy is to first zoom to the most discriminative region in the image and then extract features from there to predict image labels, discarding the rest of the image. Studying six popular networks ranging from AlexNet to CLIP, we find that proper framing of the input image can lead to the correct classification of 98.91\% of ImageNet images. Furthermore, we uncover positional biases in various datasets, especially a strong center bias in two popular datasets: ImageNet-A and ObjectNet. Finally, leveraging our insights into the potential of zooming, we propose a test-time augmentation (TTA) technique that improves classification accuracy by forcing models to explicitly perform zoom-in operations before making predictions. Our method is more interpretable, accurate, and faster than MEMO, a state-of-the-art (SOTA) TTA method. We introduce ImageNet-Hard, a new benchmark that challenges SOTA classifiers including large vision-language models even when optimal zooming is allowed.},
