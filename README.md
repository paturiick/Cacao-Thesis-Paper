# UAV-based Cacao Disease Detection

This repository contains the materials and documentation for the thesis:  
**“Automated Black Pod (Phytophthora palmivora) Disease Detection in Cacao Pods using UAV.”**

---

## 📌 Overview
Black pod disease caused by *Phytophthora palmivora* is one of the major threats to cacao production in the Philippines. Traditional manual inspection is slow, error-prone, and often detects infections too late.  

This project proposes a **UAV-enabled detection system** that uses aerial imaging, **YOLO-based deep learning**, and **geotagging with QGIS** to identify and map diseased cacao pods. The goal is to provide farmers with an **early-warning tool** that is scalable, efficient, and practical for real-world farm use.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Configure a UAV platform for cacao pod imaging.  
- Develop a YOLO-based model for detecting diseased pods.  
- Integrate GPS geotagging and visualize results in QGIS.  
- Evaluate system accuracy, geotagging precision, and usability in cacao farms.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Hardware:** DJI RoboMaster TT, NEO-M8N GPS module  
- **Software:** YOLO, QGIS, Vue.js, Django, PostgreSQL, Nginx
